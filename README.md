### DB tool - DBeaver 

### Data Modeling
   - 6 csv files were analysed to sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables. 
   - QuickDBD tool was used to sketch the ERD and then exported to PostgreSQL to generate the DDL statements

### Data Engineering
   - A new database, employee_DB is created in Postgres
   - 6 Tables created using DDL statements exported from QuickDBD: 
     - departments,titles,employee,salaries,dept_employee,dept_manager
   - The CSVs are then used to load the tables
